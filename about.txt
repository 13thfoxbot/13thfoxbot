13thfoxbot
Author: Ryan Rose AKA 13thfox
version 0.1
Written in Python 3.11 with twitchio library


DESCRIPTION

Currently only works on 13thfox's channel for development and upon release will only be available on Pomatomaster's channel.
    (though this may change in the future if I'm having fun with the project and it isn't too expensive to host.)

13thfoxbot is a minimalist twitch chatbot that will shoutout (!so name) other approved streamers in twitch chat
    automatically upon them entering chat.

13thfoxbot will shoutout channels on their first chat once a day and reset at 7 am EST.
        (this may be a variable set by command later)

---------------PSEUDOCODE-------------------

13thfoxbot's main loop will monitor message events and if the author of a message is on the whiteList and not the
    shoutedoutList. If the condition is met it will add the username to the shoutoutList.

13thfoxbot's main loop will message "!so {twitch usernames}" on the shoutoutList and add those username(s) to the
    shoutedoutList once every 5 seconds.
        (this is the only part of the code I don't have working) =(


13thfoxbot initially will have 4 commands. Only mods of Pom's channel will have the ability to use these commands.

"?add {twitch username}" will add a channel to the whitelist
"?remove {twitch username}" will remove a channel from the whitelist
"?reset" will clear the shoutedoutList and will shoutout channels on the whiteList again upon their first new chats.
    (Primarily used for if there are multiple streams in a day or very long streams and may lead to spam.)
"?help" will give a brief description about 13thfoxbot and list its commands.

? prefix was chosen as to not fight with nightbot/stream elements



CSVs

The whiteList is the list of channels approved by Pom to shoutout.
The shoutedoutList is the list of channels that have been shouted out during the stream
The shoutoutList is the list of channels the bot needs to shoutout.

Currently, the whiteList, shoutedoutList, and shoutoutList are hosted on my desktop, which isn't ideal for uptime
    but it is free.


- License -
Probably going with the MIT license. easy and permissive, though thoughts on this are welcome.
